### What works so far
Currently, this project includes STLs for 3D printing a box to contain a PCB and switches wired in with JST connectors. The base is designed to stop printing midway to place washers in as weights.

### Button Layout
There is an Illustrator file for sketching out the layout of the lid.

### PCB Info
The PCB was designed in Fusion360, as was the lid to the box, and ordered through [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/). There are cutouts in the PCB to fit the current switches.

### Hardware
This is the hardware used:
- Adafruit Pro Micro
