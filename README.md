### What works so far
Currently, this project includes STLs for 3D printing a box to contain a PCB and switches wired in with JST connectors. The base is designed to stop printing midway to place washers in as weights.

### To Do 📋
- [x] Update Readme
- [ ] Finish Programming (with mirrored switches)
- [x] Finalize Current PCB design
- [x] Finalize Box/Lid Design
- [ ] Cut New Acrylic with repositioned labels

### Button Layout 🟢🟠🔵🔴
There is an Illustrator file for sketching out the layout of the lid.

### PCB Info 📝
The PCB was designed in Fusion360, as was the lid to the box, and ordered through [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/). There are cutouts in the PCB to fit the current switches.

### Hardware 💻
This is the hardware used:
- Adafruit Pro Micro
